<h1>About Me</h1>

  Hi! I'm Mahimna Trivedi, a passionate and curious learner stepping into the world of web development. Iâ€™ve just completed my journey with HTML and am excited to keep building my skills as I dive deeper into front-end and back-end technologies. I'm on a mission to create beautiful, functional websites and grow as a full-stack developer one line of code at a time.</p>
